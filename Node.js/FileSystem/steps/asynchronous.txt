Asynchronous code is also known as non-blocking code. Unlike 
synchronous code (where code is processed lexically, in order, line by line),
asynchronous code is also known as non-blocking code.

Whilst synchronous tasks can block execution, especially 
when dealing with longer processing times, asynchronous code 
offloads heavy work to a background task, asynchronous functions
require a callback function, this starts reading the file in
the background, then immediately moves onto the next statement. 

This is alternative to the synchronous method which would wait 
for the processing to be finished. When the process is completed
the code within the callback function is called. 

This is especially useful in Node as Node is single-threaded.
The thread being the location in memory (the machines processor) 
that actually executes the code.
