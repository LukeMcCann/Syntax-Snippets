# V8

V8 is an open source JavaScript engine. What does this mean?

An engine provides core or essential funcitonality to a program. In
this case the V8 engine acts as a "translator" from JavaScript's 
more human readable format to a format the processor understands
(machine code). 

Essentially, V8 is a program, written in the C++ programming language. 
The V8 source code is open source and can be viewed and contributed to by anyone,
however some base functionality in managed via private companies. 

A famous tool running on the V8 engine is the Node runtime environment which allows 
JavaScript code to be ran on the runtime. Similarly, Chrome is built on the V8 engine.

By extending the V8 C++ program it is possible to also extend the functionality of 
JavaScript, this means that we can use JavaScript to access the filesystem, handle
file types, and much more using the V8 engine. 

Anything you can think to write in C++ can thereby be added to JavaScript by extending#
this program.
