Requiring core modules in node.js 

When the require function is called
you may recall the filename is attained via the module.
the module is then cached, meaning that future calls to the same
module require function will return the cached result.

After this the require function ultimately ends up asking
a question: 
     is $this (the thing you requested) a Native Module?

If it is the Native Module is returned, otherwise
further checks are made.

A Native Module is part of the JavsScript core inside the lib module,
these are modules which come along with Node.js
