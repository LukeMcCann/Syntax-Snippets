Funcitonal programming is a programming styles much like Object Oriented Programming.
It has grown in popularity in recent years. 

Where Object Oriented Programming is more inline with the human thought process, thinking
in terms of the noun, Functional programming is more about the verbs, rather than
thinking of things in terms of objects, funcitonal programming encourages us to 
think of things in terms of the actions being undertaken. 

If we were to described a house in an object oriented sense we would discuss the
walls, doors, windows etc... in a Functional sense we would discuss the actions
opening/closing etc...
