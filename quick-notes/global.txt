In JS we have the global window object. If we want
to access a global function, or add a variable to 
this scope we can do so:

  let name = 'Ted';
  window.console.log(window.name); // Ted
  
In Node we do not have the window object.
Instead we use the global object to access
this scope. There is a difference however, 
due to the modular nature of node, when
we create a variable it is not created
as a child of the global object. This
is because variables in node are only
accessible in the current file:

  let name = 'Tom';
  global.console.log(name); // Tom
  global.console.log(global.name); // undefined
