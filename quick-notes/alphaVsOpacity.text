The alpha channel on RGBA only affects the property it is applied to.
Any other properties remain unaffected.

Whilst opacity affects all of the properties on the element. This is because
rather than being set on a property, opacity is a property itself. Therefore
it govenrs the transparency of the entire element to which it is applied.
