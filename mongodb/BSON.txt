MongoDB is a NoSQL database. 

There are many databases under this category which differ in many different ways.
MongoDB is what is known as a document datastore. This means that unlike traditional Relational 
table-based databases (MySQL, Postgres, etc...) we store data in a format more similar to that of  how we
would store data in a JSON file. Other types of database include concepts such as Neo4JS graph based 
database, this is an interesting one if you are intrigued in storing semantic information for an AI
or Machine Learning program.

MongoDB may look like JSON, however, JSON is incredibly slow to parse due to being a text-based language.
This is not ideal if you want to have a quick and efficient database, enter BSON. BSON is a simple enough
concept, it is a language similar in syntax to JSON, but instead stored as a binary representation. Because
of this BSON takes up much less space in memory than JSON, is faster to parse, and therefore search, and 
enables us to use JSON format effectively to read and write data to and from our persistent data storage.
