    <h1>ES6 Promises</h1>
    <p>
        Promises are new to ES6 as part of the standard.
        Promises are an alternative way of handling asynchronous 
        operations, rather than using callbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are called promises because they promise to do something
        after execution of a prior method. We call promise methods
        using <code>.then</code>.
