addition is commutative - the order of operation does not matter

2 + 5 = 5 + 2

addition is associative

9 + 2 + 3 = 14
2 + 3 + 9 = 14

subtraction is not commutative - the order of operation does matter

25 - 30 = -5
30 - 25 = 5 

subtraction is not associative

10 - (5 - 1) = 6 
(10 - 5) - 1 = 4 


Multiplication can be viewed as repeated addition 

Multiplication is commutative 

2 x 5 = 5 x 2

Multiplication is associative

2 x 3 x 4 = 24
6 x 4 = 24
2 x 12 = 24

Division is not associative

Division is not commutative - division can be viewed as repeated subtraction

(10 / 5) / 2 = 1
10 / (5 / 2) = 4
