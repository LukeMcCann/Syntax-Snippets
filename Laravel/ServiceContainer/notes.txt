Laravel Service Container
--------------------------

The service container is the bedrock of the entire Framework.

A ServiceContainer is just what it sounds like: a container for services.
It is a repository for which to store and retrieve "services". A service
may be any kind of data: String, Object, Collection etc...

To store things wihtin the container we use the bind() method provided by Laravel.
This method takes a $key, and some data to associate with the $key.

It is important to realise that Laravel's ServiceContainer is actually the application
itself, which can be accessed via the app() helper function. 

// app()->bind('hello', function () { return 'Hello World'; });

We usually use the service container to instantiate dependencies for dependency injection. 

// app()->bind('example', function () { return new Example });

Instantiation can sometimes be more complex than simply creating a new object instance,
for instance, in some cases we may need to create multiple objects beforehand that 
this object is dependent upon. 

The bind method simply adds our binding to the ServiceContainers bindings array. 
This is essentually adding an item to our repoistory. 

If we want to resolve our callback, we can do so by calling the resolve method on the container,
passing the key we want to access. 

// $example = resolve('example');

In servives.php we set up the config for our objects. A problem with dependency injection
is how you need to know exactly what classes to instantiate an object, the ServiceContainer
aims to solve this. This means we can store our config in one of our config files by simply
returning an array. 

// return [ 'config' => 'config_example' ];

we can then read this config prior to instantiation within our callback function.

// app()->bind('example', function () {
//  $config = config('services.config');
// });

Laravel can also resolve bindings using some behind the scenes magic: 
// $example = resolve(App\Exmaple::class);

This is due to how Laravel handles abstract and concrete classes prior to resolving. 
You can see this in the Container.php how the abstract is checked against a concrete
implementation. Laravel will also inject any additional dependencies passed.

For example: if we had a class Example which I dependency injected a class Collaborator,
Laravel will instantly resolve both the example and collaborator correctly, even without
manual binding. 

Laravel does this by first checking the passed key in its container. In this case it looks
and finds nothing. It next checks if the passed key is a class, in this case it is. 
Laravel therefore instantiates Example. Next, it reads the constructor arguments in Example.
It sees Collaborator being injected into Example. As Collaborator is a dependency of Example, 
Example is unable to be instantiated wihtout it, therefore Laravel checks the Collaborator. 
If the class can be instantiated, it will then instantiate a Collaborator.

allternatively, rather than using the resolve() helper you can also call the make function on
the app() instance which will provide the same result: app()->make(App\Example::class);

Laravel will implicitly call the resolve method each time we ask for a dependency in the
same manner.

// Route::get('/' function (App\Example $example) { ddd($example); });

If there is an issue with a dependency, you will receive BindingResolutionException
This exception is Laravel saying:
  "I am trying to help you out here, but I don't know what type this dependency is, and there is no class associated"
In this situration you would need to go back and ensure explicit typing/binding, usually performed within a ServiceProvider. 


The important takeaway here is the order of operations:

WHEN: We request a dependency wihtin our Controller
FIRST: Laravel will check if we have a matching type in the bindings array
IF: Laravel does not find a matching key in bindings
THEN: it will check if there is a class matching the injected item
IF: There is a class, then Laravel will build that class automatically

We would usually register our services in the services container. This means we perform all of our
bindings for explicit dependencies within our register function in AppServiceProvider or a derivitive provider.
Finally, on any provider we have access to app() via the specific provider instance: $this->app->bind()
