Laravel Service Container
--------------------------

Bedrock of the entire Framework

A ServiceContainer is just what it sounds like: a container for services.
It is a repository for which to store and retrieve "services". A service
may be any kind of data: String, Object, Collection etc...


To store things wihtin the container we use the bind() method provided by Laravel.
This method takes a $key, and some data to associate with the $key.
