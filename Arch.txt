# Installing Nvidia Drivers

First we need to check which GPU we are running

lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"

In some cases you will see two, this is a hybrid GPU, for me this is an integrated intel and nvidia GPU in my laptop. 

The following steps will ensure that we can use both.

check your drivers are compatible: 
https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/CodeNames.html
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PRIME#Closed-source_drivers

install drivers:
sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils nvidia-settings

Since xorg v 127 the xorg config is no longer needed because the options are included in the driver directly.

We do need to install nvidia-prime however

sudo pacman -S nvidia-prime


We can then reboot

and test via

sudo prime-run glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"

the output expected: 
OpenGL renderer string: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070/PCIe/SSE2


# Managing the GPU

You can check which GPU is being used in KDE in the info centre. 

For me at this point this shows my intel GPU the enxt steps will let us swap between nvidia and intel.

we can switch to our Nvidia gpu using: prime-run program

This is a manual method doing this from the terminal.
