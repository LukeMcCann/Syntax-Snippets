# Installing Nvidia Drivers

First we need to check which GPU we are running

lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"

In some cases you will see two, this is a hybrid GPU, for me this is an integrated intel and nvidia GPU in my laptop. 

The following steps will ensure that we can use both.

check your drivers are compatible: 
https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/CodeNames.html
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PRIME#Closed-source_drivers

install drivers:
sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils nvidia-settings

Since xorg v 127 the xorg config is no longer needed because the options are included in the driver directly.

We do need to install nvidia-prime however

sudo pacman -S nvidia-prime


We can then reboot

and test via

sudo prime-run glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"

the output expected: 
OpenGL renderer string: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070/PCIe/SSE2
